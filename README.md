Hi! 👋 

I'm Mélanie! After 20 years as a Stadium Manager and Event Manager in Bordeaux, Paris and Lille, I'm finally starting a new career challenge in web development, as a junior!

I'm trained in Ruby & Ruby on Rails, JS, HTML/CSS, Git and GitHub thanks to Le Wagon Bordeaux.

Already 2️⃣ delivered projects for Le Wagon:

🚀 MamieExpress: https://mamieexpress.herokuapp.com

🚀 Buddy-bot: https://www.awesomescreenshot.com/video/6309521?key=164e5ff41d72b5a399e7fd99187858a9

As my training at Le Wagon is over, I'm starting to learn by myself, by reading Ruby on Rails Tutorial 📖.

I'm also looking for good advices 💬 about RSPEC, so do not hesitate to send me an email at melanie.couronne@gmail.com to share your experience 🤝.
